ORBit is somthing I plan on eventually adding to an app store such as Steam, but this is not likely to happen soon. 
To run the program, you will need python and pygame installed, since it is written in pygame. 

When you first run/open the program, you will see a screen filled with dots. Click anywhere an the screen to place a 'pole'. A pole acts as a source of gravity, pulling the dots toward it. You can place more than one pole. 
If you press P, it will pause the game. Press P again to unpause. 
Move the cusor to the edge of the screen in order to pan the screen in that direction.
use the scroll wheel to zoom in/out from the point of the cursor.

You will have to close the program by pressing escape and reopen it to reset it, since I am still working on some features.

You may need a fast computer to run this, because of the large number of dots. This will use up a lot of RAM. I am working on increasing preformance, and am sorry if it is not able to run on your computer.

The reason I added this to GitHub was because I wanted feedback. 
If you want to add feedback, please Email me at cloppercharles244@gmail.com. If you want me to respond, please say so in the Email. 
Feel free to tell me about any crashes, bugs, or things you want to see in this in the future.

As said above, you may copy and modify the code for personal use, please do not add to, and then commercialy reproduce this program.
